# glysp
Experimental language inspired by Go, Lisp, and Python.

Written in Go this language features Lisp syntax, a Python inspired object system, and Go-based goroutines + channels. This is an experiment and an educational adventure in Go, not to be used in production anywhere (unless you like to live dangerously).

Currently undocumented, see examples folder for usage.
